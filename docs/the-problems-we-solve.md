ðŸš¨ The Problems We Solve
</h1>

**Challenges Facing Centralized Funding Platforms**

- **High Fees:** Significant cuts taken from creators' hard-earned support.

- **Locked & Delayed Payouts:** Funds held hostage, hindering creators' ability to work.

- **Lack of Transparency:** Donors often have no visibility into how their contributions are used.

- **Censorship & De-platforming:** Centralized control risks account freezes or removals.

- **No Native Crypto Support:** Traditional platforms largely ignore the growing crypto economy, missing a massive, engaged donor base and limiting frictionless, global on-chain contributions.
  
- **Limited Innovation:** Standardized tools stifle unique creator-supporter interactions (like NFT rewards or token-based incentives).
