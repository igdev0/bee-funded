ðŸ”— How We Leverage Chainlink
</h1>

# ðŸŽ² Chainlink VRF

We use verifiable randomness to enable the pool creator to airdrop NFTs to a randomly selected donor. 

Chainlink VRF provides cryptographically secure, on-chain randomness. When a winner is selected from a donor pool, the random number used for the selection is generated and verified by Chainlink's oracle network. This process is fully auditable and tamper-proof.

This eliminates any doubt about fairness. Creators can confidently offer exciting incentives to drive engagement, and supporters know they have a legitimate chance to be rewarded for their contribution. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for building trust and making community support more interactive and fun.

# ðŸ“Š Chainlink Data Feeds

We use data feeds to calculate the total value of a donation pool before swapping or before donation.

Chainlink Data Feeds are decentralized oracle networks that provide highly reliable, tamper-resistant price data for a wide range of assets. Before a supporter makes a donation or a creator views their pool's total, we call on these feeds to get the latest, accurate conversion rates (e.g., ETH to USDC).

This provides absolute clarity and solves the problem of financial ambiguity. Creators can set and track meaningful goals for their **Targeted Fundraising** pools in familiar currency terms. Supporters can instantly see the real-world impact of their contribution, fostering greater confidence and trust in the platform and the creators they support.

# ðŸ¤– Chainlink Automations

We utilize this feature to automate batch ERC-20 token transfers for the subscriptions of a given donation pool.

Chainlink Automations is a decentralized service that reliably automates smart contract functions. We use it to trigger recurring, batched ERC-20 token transfers for subscriptions. Once a supporter opts in, Chainlink Automations ensures that the scheduled payments are executed on time, every time, without any manual intervention from the creator or supporter.

This provides creators with a predictable and consistent on-chain income stream they can count on for long-term project planning. For supporters, itâ€™s the ultimate convenience. For the platform, it ensures that a core revenue feature is decentralized and highly reliable, removing single points of failure and building a truly resilient system for creator sustainability.
